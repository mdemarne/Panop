## About
Some internal search system for website are simply not fast enough.
Often, external indexed-based search tool are not sufficient either,
especially when the data is moving fast. 

One way to avoid this is to do online analysis and research: this is what 
Panop is for.

Panop will provide you a slick interface that allow you select the settings
of a search and complex queries, as well as domain boundaries and search
depth. It will then return to you a list of URLs matching your requirements
and allow you to browse through it.

Panop is a command-based tool.

its settings.
